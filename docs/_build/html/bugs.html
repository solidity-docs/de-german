<p>Below, you can find a JSON-formatted list of some of the known security-relevant bugs in the
Solidity compiler. The file itself is hosted in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs.json">Github repository</a>.
The list stretches back as far as version 0.3.0, bugs known to be present only
in versions preceding that are not listed.</p>
<p>There is another file called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs_by_version.json">bugs_by_version.json</a>,
which can be used to check which bugs affect a specific version of the compiler.</p>
<p>Contract source verification tools and also other tools interacting with
contracts should consult this list according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is mildly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a nightly
compiler version instead of a released version. This list does not keep
track of unreleased or nightly versions.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also mildly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a version that was
not the most recent at the time the contract was created. For contracts
created from other contracts, you have to follow the creation chain
back to a transaction and use the date of that transaction as creation date.</p></li>
<li><p>It is highly suspicious if a contract was compiled with a compiler that
contains a known bug and the contract was created at a time where a newer
compiler version containing a fix was already released.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The JSON file of known bugs below is an array of objects, one for each bug,
with the following keys:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>uid</dt><dd><p>Unique identifier given to the bug in the form of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SOL-&lt;year&gt;-&lt;number&gt;</span></code>.
It is possible that multiple entries exists with the same uid. This means
multiple version ranges are affected by the same bug.</p>
</dd>
<dt>name</dt><dd><p>Unique name given to the bug</p>
</dd>
<dt>summary</dt><dd><p>Short description of the bug</p>
</dd>
<dt>description</dt><dd><p>Detailed description of the bug</p>
</dd>
<dt>link</dt><dd><p>URL of a website with more detailed information, optional</p>
</dd>
<dt>introduced</dt><dd><p>The first published compiler version that contained the bug, optional</p>
</dd>
<dt>fixed</dt><dd><p>The first published compiler version that did not contain the bug anymore</p>
</dd>
<dt>publish</dt><dd><p>The date at which the bug became known publicly, optional</p>
</dd>
<dt>severity</dt><dd><p>Severity of the bug: very low, low, medium, high. Takes into account
discoverability in contract tests, likelihood of occurrence and
potential damage by exploits.</p>
</dd>
<dt>conditions</dt><dd><p>Conditions that have to be met to trigger the bug. The following
keys can be used:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">optimizer</span></code>, Boolean value which
means that the optimizer has to be switched on to enable the bug.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evmVersion</span></code>, a string that indicates which EVM version compiler
settings trigger the bug. The string can contain comparison
operators. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;&gt;=constantinople&quot;</span></code> means that the bug
is present when the EVM version is set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">constantinople</span></code> or
later.
If no conditions are given, assume that the bug is present.</p>
</dd>
<dt>check</dt><dd><p>This field contains different checks that report whether the smart contract
contains the bug or not. The first type of check are Javascript regular
expressions that are to be matched against the source code (âsource-regexâ)
if the bug is present.  If there is no match, then the bug is very likely
not present. If there is a match, the bug might be present.  For improved
accuracy, the checks should be applied to the source code after stripping
comments.
The second type of check are patterns to be checked on the compact AST of
the Solidity program (âast-compact-json-pathâ). The specified search query
is a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath">JsonPath</a> expression.
If at least one path of the Solidity AST matches the query, the bug is
likely present.</p>

The correct operation would be to sign-extend the value, i.e. set the higher order bits to one if the sign bit is one. This sign-extension is performed by Solidity just prior to when it matters, i.e. when a value is stored in memory, when it is compared or when a division is performed. Because of that, to our knowledge, the only way to access the value in its unclean state is by reading it through inline assembly.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

When decoding data from memory (instead of calldata), the ABI decoder did not properly validate some of these pointers. More specifically, it was possible to use large values for the pointers inside arrays such that computing the offset resulted in an undetected overflow. This could lead to these pointers targeting areas in memory outside of the actual area to be decoded. This way, it was possible for ``abi.decode`` to return different values for the same encoded byte array.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;description&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Solidity&#39;s bytecode optimizer has a step that can compute Keccak-256 hashes, if the contents of the memory are known during compilation time. This step also has a mechanism to determine that two Keccak-256 hashes are equal even if the values in memory are not known during compile time. This mechanism had a bug where Keccak-256 of the same memory content, but different sizes were considered equal. More specifically, ``keccak256(mpos1, length1)`` and ``keccak256(mpos2, length2)`` in some cases were considered equal if ``length1`` and ``length2``, when rounded up to nearest multiple of 32 were the same, and when the memory contents at ``mpos1`` and ``mpos2`` can be deduced to be equal. You maybe affected if you compute multiple Keccak-256 hashes of the same content, but with different lengths inside inline assembly. You are unaffected if your code uses ``keccak256`` with a length that is not a compile-time constant or if it is always a multiple of 32.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

        <span class="s2">&quot;description&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Consider a dynamically-sized array in storage whose base-type is small enough such that multiple values can be packed into a single slot, such as `uint128[]`. Let us define its length to be `l`. When this array gets assigned from another array with a smaller length, say `m`, the slots between elements `m` and `l` have to be cleaned by zeroing them out. However, this cleaning was not performed properly. Specifically, after the slot corresponding to `m`, only the first packed value was cleaned up. If this array gets resized to a length larger than `m`, the indices corresponding to the unclean parts of the slot contained the original value, instead of 0. The resizing here is performed by assigning to the array `length`, by a `push()` or via inline assembly. You are not affected if you are only using `.push(&lt;arg&gt;)` or if you assign a value (even zero) to the new elements after increasing the length of the array.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

At jump destinations, multiple code paths join and thus it has to compute a common state from the incoming edges. Computing this common state was not done correctly. This bug can cause data corruption, but it is probably quite hard to use for targeted attacks.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
